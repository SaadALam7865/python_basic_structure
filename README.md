🚀 My First Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my first Python journey! 🐍 This repository contains basic Python exercises, including fun projects and practice sets that showcase my learning progress. From text-to-speech applications to file handling, I’m exploring the core features of Python step by step.


🔥 Features
✅ Joke Generator using pyjokes for a fun coding experience.
✅ Text-to-Speech Converter with pyttsx3 to make Python talk! 🎙️
✅ File Handling using os module for exploring directories.
✅ Practice Set 1: Prints the classic poem "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" using multi-line strings.

📂 Code Highlights
1️⃣ Joke Generator
python
Copy
Edit
import pyjokes
joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
print(joke)
Generates a random joke for some coding fun! 😄

2️⃣ Text-to-Speech (TTS)
python
Copy
Edit
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("I love Python programming language")
engine.runAndWait()
Converts text into speech with ease! 🔊

3️⃣ File Handling Example
python
Copy
Edit
import os
directory_path = "/"
contents = os.listdir(directory_path)
print(contents)
Lists all files and directories at the root location. 📂

🧠 What I Learned
Understanding multi-line strings using triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """).
Working with external libraries like pyjokes and pyttsx3.
Basic file handling with Python’s os module.
